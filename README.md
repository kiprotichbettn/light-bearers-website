# Light Bearers Website

Light Bearers is a community-focused organization that supports high school and university students by providing tools and programs to help them grow socially, academically, and economically. This website shares our mission, highlights our programs, leadership messages, videos, free Christian eBooks, announcements, events, and info about our satellite branches.
